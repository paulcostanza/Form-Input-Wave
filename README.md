# Form Input Wave

A simple login form with a fun little animation. 

When focusing on the input, the input label creates a wave like animation. 

For this project I was able to practice a lot of CSS that was new to me, specifically the pseudo selectors ***focus***, ***active***, and ***valid***.

For the JavaScript, I was able to play around with the ***split***, ***map***, and ***join*** methods to create the wave-like effect.
